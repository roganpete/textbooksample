## Improvement Suggestions

No critical or high-priority improvements needed. The course description is ready for learning graph generation as-is.

**Optional enhancements (Priority: Low):**
- Could add a note about nonpartisan framing to reinforce the "Topics Not Covered" boundary around partisan positions
- Could mention accessibility considerations for volunteers with disabilities in the canvassing context

These are minor refinements and do not affect readiness or concept generation potential.
