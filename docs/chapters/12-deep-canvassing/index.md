# Deep Canvassing

## Summary

This chapter explores deep canvassing — an evidence-based approach to changing minds through extended, empathetic conversations. You will learn about the research behind deep canvassing, how it differs from traditional canvassing, and its core techniques: narrative exchange, analogic listening, non-judgmental curiosity, perspective taking, and processing questions. The chapter also covers the science of attitude change, emotional processing, the ten-point scale rating method, and how to plan and train for deep canvassing operations. After completing this chapter, you will understand how to conduct meaningful, long-form conversations that can genuinely shift voter attitudes.
