# How to Volunteer for Political Canvassing and Door Knocking

**Title:** How to Volunteer for Political Canvassing and Door Knocking

**Target Audience:** Adult continuing education — community members interested in civic participation through volunteer campaign work, voter outreach, and grassroots political engagement.

**Prerequisites:** Basic civics knowledge — a general understanding of elections, voting, and political processes.

## Course Overview

This course prepares community members to become effective volunteers in political campaigns and voter outreach efforts. Participants will learn the fundamentals of canvassing, door knocking, phone banking, text banking, and persuasive voter conversations — the core activities that drive grassroots political engagement.

Volunteering for political campaigns is one of the most direct ways citizens can participate in democracy beyond casting their own vote. Whether knocking on doors in a neighborhood, making phone calls to registered voters, or sending targeted text messages, volunteers serve as the human connection between candidates, causes, and the electorate. This course demystifies the volunteer experience, from signing up for a first shift to mastering advanced techniques like deep canvassing.

The course covers the full spectrum of voter contact methods, from traditional face-to-face door knocking to modern phone and text banking operations. Participants will also learn Get Out the Vote (GOTV) strategies used in the final days before an election and explore deep canvassing — an evidence-based approach to changing minds through extended, empathetic conversations. By the end of this training, participants will have the confidence and skills to show up, contribute meaningfully, and make a difference in their communities.

## Main Topics Covered

1. **Elections** — Understanding the electoral landscape, election cycles, types of elections (primary, general, local, state, federal), and how volunteer efforts fit into the broader campaign ecosystem.

4. **Doing Your First Volunteer Shift** — Step-by-step preparation for a first shift, what to bring, what to wear, how check-in and training work, and overcoming common anxieties.
5. **Door Knocking** — Mechanics of walking a turf, reading a walk list or canvassing app, approaching a door, introducing yourself, delivering a message, and recording responses.
6. **Face-to-Face Conversations with Voters** — Building rapport at the door, active listening, handling objections, staying on message, reading body language, and knowing when to move on.
7. **Phone Banking** — Setting up for a phone bank session, using auto-dialers and call scripts, leaving effective voicemails, tracking call outcomes, and managing rejection.
8. **Text Banking** — How peer-to-peer texting platforms work, crafting effective text messages, responding to replies, compliance with messaging regulations, and scaling outreach.
9. **Persuasive Conversations** — Techniques for persuading undecided voters, framing issues effectively, storytelling as a persuasion tool, avoiding common pitfalls, and respecting voter autonomy.
10. **GOTV — Get Out the Vote** — The purpose and urgency of GOTV operations, mobilization versus persuasion, Election Day logistics, poll monitoring basics, and last-touch voter contact strategies.
11. **Deep Canvassing** — The science behind deep canvassing, how it differs from traditional canvassing, building empathy through narrative exchange, evidence of effectiveness in shifting attitudes, and when to use this approach.
